# pydwf

This is *pydwf*, a Python 3 wrapper for the Digilent Waveforms library.

The project is hosted on github:

https://github.com/sidneycadot/pydwf/

The project is hosted on PyPI, making it possible to install it using the standard pip tool:

```sh
pip install pydwf
```

https://pypi.org/project/pydwf/

The project documentation will be hosted on readthedocs in the near future.
For now, the documentation can easily be installed locally after installing the package,
by executing the following command:

```python
python -m pydwf extract-html-docs
```

This will create a local directory called *pydwf-docs-html* containing the project documentation.
