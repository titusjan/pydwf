TODO:

- Make sure we can put docs on readthedocs.io
- Complete the documentation.

Issues with the C header file as delivered with the SDK:

- In dwf.h, function FDwfDigitalInInputOrderSet, parameter 'fDioFirst' is a bool. This type doesn't exist in C, unless 'stdbool.h' is included.
- There's a bunch of lines in dwf.h with trailing spaces.
- The comment on the line describing the "dwfercUnknownError" constant is incorrect.
- In the definition of the DwfAnalogImpedance type constants, Admittance, Conductance, and Susceptance are commented as having unit 'Siemen',
    which should be "Siemens".
- The function 'FDwfAnalogInTriggerHoldOffInfo' has a parameter that is called 'pnStep' rather than 'pnSteps'.

Open issues, dwfsdk.pdf:

- Section 1.2 "the standard c-type bool". "bool" is not a standard C type, Bool_t is.
- Section 2 "FDwfGetLastError: bad description of "dwfercUnknownError".
- Section 2 "FDwfParamSet": not all DwfParam values found in the header file are described here.
- Section 4: not documented: FDwfDeviceEnableSet, FDwfDeviceParamGet, FDwfDebiceParamSet.
- Section 4: TRIGSRC values High and Low are not documented.
